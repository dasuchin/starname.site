# Origins

This is a conversion of a previous non laravel project into the Laravel framework as an exercise in learning Laravel. It was my first personal project using Laravel. That said you should expect a lot of aspects to not be up to par with my current standards. I haven't worked on it in quite a while and I made it public mostly as a code sample reference. It did however function 100% at the time that I "finished" it.
