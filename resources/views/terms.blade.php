                <h1>Terms of Service / Terms of Use</h1>
                <p>
                    In order to use our services you must agree to certain terms intended to both protect our rights as a website and your rights as a consumer.

                <h3>LEGITIMACY OF CLAIM</h3>
                <p>
                    Celestialcodex.com does not claim to be legally able to claim a real star in the night sky, such "claim" is simply a novelty gift and not officially sanctioned by the IAU (International Astronomical Union). Under no circumstances shall a refund be issued to a customer based on either not understanding or not realizing this.
                </p>
                <h3>ACCURACY OF STAR MAPS</h3>
                <p>
                    Provided star maps are artistic renderings based upon scientifically accurate star charts and may not be entirely accurate. These maps are intended as a vanity item and are mostly just an add-on item to signify your claim. There are a number of factors that went into the creation of these star maps and with the conversion process from star map to computer graphic the formulas have a wide range for error. Celestialcodex.com does not claim that said maps are accurate in any way shape or form and should be treated as a work of art.
                </p>
                <h3>LOCATION OF STAR</h3>
                <p>
                    When you utilize our services you are assigned a star randomly based on a number of factors, though Celestialcodex.com makes no promises of anything specific for your star. We try our best to match you with a star in or near your chosen zodiac constellation but due to a variety of reasons this can not always be the case. No refunds will be given based upon the specifics of the star assigned.
                </p>
                <h3>STAR MAGNITUDE</h3>
                <p>
                    Purchasing a magnitude upgrade is not a guarantee for a specific magnitude, merely a bump up to a higher range of stars. The magnitude ranges are clearly stated on the magnitude selection page. If somehow you are assigned a star outside of the stated ranges you may be able to receive a correction star to rectify the situation. No refunds will be given for dissatisfaction of magnitude as there is a random factor to star selection.
                </p>
                <h3>REFUNDS</h3>
                <p>
                    Refunds will not be given under any circumstances due to the digital nature of the products sold. We are not able to "take back" the products once you purchase them, there's nothing stopping you from making copies and sending it to other people or storing a copy on your own personal computer. If you are unhappy for whatever reason not directly mentioned above then you "might" be eligible for a new star. This is entirely up to the discretion of Celestialcodex.com and subject to change at any time.
